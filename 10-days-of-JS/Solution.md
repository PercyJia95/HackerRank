**Objective**

In this challenge, we learn about *Arrays*.

**Task**

Complete the *getSecondLargest* function in the editor below. It has one parameter: an array, *nums* , of  *n* numbers. The function must find and return the second largest number in *nums*.

**Input Format**

Locked stub code in the editor reads the following input from stdin and passes it to the function: 

The first line contains an integer, *n*, denoting the size of the *nums* array. 
The second line contains *n* space-separated numbers describing the elements in *nums*.

**Constraints**

- 1 =< n =< 10
- 0 =< numsi =< 100, where numsi is the number at index .
- The numbers in nums  are not distinct.

**Output Format**

Return the value of the second largest number in the  array.

**Sample Input 0**

```
5
2 3 6 6 5
```

**Sample Output 0**

```
5
```

**Explanation 0**

Given the array = [2,3,6,6,5] , we see that the largest value in the array is 6 and the second largest value is 5. Thus, we return 5 as our answer.
